## Folder Structure

<p>
    Please take a look into the folder structure for both folders. I have placed two sub-folders inside each one, those sub-folders holds the data to be loaded and to be exported and the other folder holds the logic implemented to calculate mathematical functions and the other one is for manipulate files.

```
├── pyBank/
│   ├── data
│   │   ├── budget_data.csv
│   │   ├── budget_data.text
│   ├── modules
│   │   ├── calculator_class.py
│   │   ├── file_class.py

```


## Notes
<p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> I could not download the entire election_data.csv from the remote server, so I have worked with the 2022386 well formed rows.
